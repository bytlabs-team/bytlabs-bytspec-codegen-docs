# BytSpec: Introduction

**BytSpec** is a tool for generating code from structured specifications based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. BytSpec uses a simple JSON file to define the core elements of an application: **bounded contexts**, **domains**, and **commands**. This approach helps developers focus on high-level design while automating repetitive coding tasks.

## How It Works

1. **Define Your System in JSON**: Use BytSpec's JSON specification to set up:
   - **Bounded Contexts**: Separate areas of your application, each representing a distinct business function.
   - **Domains**: Specific business entities and processes within each context.
   - **Commands**: Actions that trigger changes in the system, like user requests or events.

2. **Generate Code Automatically**: Once the JSON spec is complete, BytSpecâ€™s code generator:
   - Builds project structures for each context and domain.
   - Creates basic code for command handlers, ready for your business logic.

BytSpec helps streamline development by providing a clear structure, from design to code, making it easier to maintain and scale applications.
